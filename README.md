<h2>About me</h2>

<p> My name is Justin Russell, I'm originally from Idaho, I moved to Utah in 2003 primarly for the skiing and mountain biking. I graduated with an an associates  degree in fire science and spent the last 15 years of my life working in emergency medical services and the ski industry. I recently found a desire to learn web development. This is week 3 in my coding camp and find it to be challengeing but very fulfilling and rewarding.</p>


<h2>My work</h2>
  
You will find two of my recent projects on the porfolio, Run-Buddy and Horiseon code refactor.
<li> Horiseon Code refactor: took existing html code and reformated for eaier readability as well as consolidated CSS in the style sheet.</li>
<li> Run-Buddy landing page: Worked with modules to setup basic Html code and then style with CSS.</li>
